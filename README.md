## Key Features

The code implements the following key features:

### Web Scraping & Summarization

The `ASUWebScraper` class handles web scraping of ASU pages:

- Uses Selenium for dynamic content and BeautifulSoup for static HTML parsing
- Implements methods for scraping specific ASU resources like course catalogs, library resources, and job postings
- Extracts content using both Selenium-based scraping and Jina AI-powered content extraction

The `DataPreprocessor` class handles summarization:

- Cleans and structures scraped text using NLP techniques like tokenization and lemmatization
- Uses AI agents (likely the Gemini model) to refine and summarize content

### Discord Integration

The `DiscordState` class manages the Discord bot's state and interactions:

- Initializes Discord intents for message content and member access
- Tracks user information, roles, and channel details
- Provides methods to update and retrieve bot state

### AI-Driven Information Retrieval

The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture:

- The `VectorStore` class manages document storage and retrieval using Qdrant vector database
- Implements semantic search capabilities using HuggingFace embeddings
- The `Utils` class contains methods for similarity search and database querying
- The `RAPTOR ` class reranks and creates a tree of documents

### Utils Class Enhancements

- **Multi-Method Search**: Orchestrates searches across RAPTOR, similarity, and MIPS methods.

### Webhooks

The system uses various sets of custom web scraping functions with search query manipulation to fetch most results-

- The `ASUWebScraper` class can be extended to fetch data from different ASU platforms

## Database Integration

The ASU Discord Bot utilizes two database systems for different purposes:

### Vector Store Operations

- **Qdrant Integration**: Utilizes Qdrant for efficient vector storage and retrieval.

- **Automatic Index Building**: Dynamically constructs search indexes for improved query performance.

### Google Sheets Database

The `GoogleSheet` class manages interactions with a Google Sheets database, primarily used for moderator oversight and user tracking.

Key features:

- User Management: Stores and retrieves user information, including Discord IDs, names, and email addresses.
- Function Call Tracking: Increments counters for various bot function calls, allowing moderators to monitor usage patterns.
- Data Retrieval: Provides methods to fetch all users or specific user data.
- Data Updates: Allows updating user-specific information in the spreadsheet.

Implementation details:

- Uses the Google Sheets API for read and write operations.

- Provides error handling and logging for database operations.

### Firestore Database

The `Firestore` class manages interactions with Google's Firestore, used for storing bot-related data and chat histories.

Key features:

- Chat History: Stores complete conversation histories between users and the bot.
- Message Categorization: Organizes messages by different agent types (action, discord, google, live status, search).
- Real-time Updates: Leverages Firestore's real-time capabilities for instant data synchronization.

Implementation details:

- Initializes a Firestore client using Firebase Admin SDK.
- Implements methods to update collections, add new messages, and retrieve chat histories.

### Extensible Design

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the ASU Discord Bot on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashworks1706/SparkyAI.git
cd sparkyai
```

---

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

#### On Linux/Mac:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python.12.3 packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Configure API Keys and Credentials

The bot requires several API keys and configuration files to function properly.

1. **Create a `appConfig.json` file** in the `config/` folder with the following structure [Example](/__sample__appConfig.json):
2. **Add Firebase API credentials** [Example](/__sample_firebase_secret.json):

   - Download the `firebase_secret.json` file from your Firebase Cloud Console.
   - Place it in the `config/` folder.

---

### 5. Install Docker

The project uses Docker for containerization, which simplifies deployment and ensures consistent environments across different systems.

Follow [Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system:

- **Windows**: Install Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend
- **macOS**: Install Docker Desktop
- **Linux**: Install Docker and Docker Compose separately

For Linux users, install Docker Compose if not included with your Docker installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-compose  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install docker-compose      # Fedora
```

---

### 6. Run the Bot with Docker

The project has been containerized with Docker to handle all dependencies (including Chrome/Chromedriver for web scraping) and services automatically. The setup is optimized for cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows WSL, macOS).

#### Build and start all services:

```bash
# For Docker Compose v2 (newer installations)
docker compose up -d

# For Docker Compose v1 (older installations)
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will:

- Build the Docker image with all required dependencies
- Start the main application (Discord bot)
- Start the background fetch service
- Set up and run the Qdrant vector database
- Configure networking between services

#### View application logs:

```bash
# View logs for the main Discord bot
docker compose logs -f app

# View logs for the background fetch service
docker compose logs -f background-fetch
```

#### Stop all services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see logs indicating that the bot has started successfully when you check the app logs.

#### Platform-Specific Notes:

- **Windows/WSL**: The Docker setup includes virtual display configuration for headless Chrome
- **macOS M1/M2/M3 Users**: The image will automatically use the ARM64 architecture
- **Linux**: Includes all necessary system libraries for Chrome

---

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Docker Container Issues:**

   - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.
   - Check container status with `docker-compose ps`
   - View specific container logs with:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs -f service_name
     ```
   - Restart services with `docker-compose restart service_name`
2. **Missing API Keys:**

   - Double-check that your `config/appConfig.json` file is correctly formatted.
   - Ensure `config/firebase_secret.json` is properly set up.
   - Make sure these files are in the config directory before building Docker images.
3. **Network Issues:**

   - Ensure ports 6333 and 6334 are available for Qdrant.
   - Check if services can communicate using the Docker network.
   - Verify no firewall is blocking container communications.
4. **Volume Permissions:**

   - Check permissions on mounted volumes if you encounter access issues:
     ```bash
     ls -la config/ logs/ qdrant_storage/
     ```
   - Fix permissions if needed: `sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) config/ logs/ qdrant_storage/`
