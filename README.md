## Key Features

The code implements the following key features:

### Web Scraping & Summarization

The `ASUWebScraper` class handles web scraping of ASU pages:

- Uses Selenium for dynamic content and BeautifulSoup for static HTML parsing
- Implements methods for scraping specific ASU resources like course catalogs, library resources, and job postings
- Extracts content using both Selenium-based scraping and Jina AI-powered content extraction

The `DataPreprocessor` class handles summarization:

- Cleans and structures scraped text using NLP techniques like tokenization and lemmatization
- Uses AI agents (likely the Gemini model) to refine and summarize content

### Discord Integration

The `DiscordState` class manages the Discord bot's state and interactions:

- Initializes Discord intents for message content and member access
- Tracks user information, roles, and channel details
- Provides methods to update and retrieve bot state

### AI-Driven Information Retrieval

The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture:

- The `VectorStore` class manages document storage and retrieval using Qdrant vector database
- Implements semantic search capabilities using HuggingFace embeddings
- The `Utils` class contains methods for similarity search and database querying
- The `RAPTOR ` class reranks and creates a tree of documents

### Utils Class Enhancements

- **Multi-Method Search**: Orchestrates searches across RAPTOR, similarity, and MIPS methods.
- **Result Merging**: Intelligently combines and deduplicates results from various search methods.
- **Ground Source Management**: Tracks and manages unique source URLs for comprehensive information retrieval.
- **Caching**: Implements query and document ID caching for improved performance.

### Webhooks

The system uses various sets of custom web scraping functions with search query manipulation to fetch most results-

- The `ASUWebScraper` class can be extended to fetch data from different ASU platforms

## Database Integration

The ASU Discord Bot utilizes two database systems for different purposes:

### Vector Store Operations

- **Qdrant Integration**: Utilizes Qdrant for efficient vector storage and retrieval.
- **MIPS Search**: Implements Maximum Inner Product Search for optimized similarity queries.
- **HNSWlib Indexing**: Builds and uses HNSW indexes for fast approximate nearest neighbor search.
- **Automatic Index Building**: Dynamically constructs search indexes for improved query performance.

### Google Sheets Database

The `GoogleSheet` class manages interactions with a Google Sheets database, primarily used for moderator oversight and user tracking.

Key features:

- User Management: Stores and retrieves user information, including Discord IDs, names, and email addresses.
- Function Call Tracking: Increments counters for various bot function calls, allowing moderators to monitor usage patterns.
- Data Retrieval: Provides methods to fetch all users or specific user data.
- Data Updates: Allows updating user-specific information in the spreadsheet.

Implementation details:

- Provides error handling and logging for database operations.

### Firestore Database

The `Firestore` class manages interactions with Google's Firestore, used for storing bot-related data and chat histories.

Key features:

- Chat History: Stores complete conversation histories between users and the bot.
- Message Categorization: Organizes messages by different agent types (action, discord, google, live status, search).
- Real-time Updates: Leverages Firestore's real-time capabilities for instant data synchronization.

Implementation details:

- Initializes a Firestore client using Firebase Admin SDK.
- Implements methods to update collections, add new messages, and retrieve chat histories.

### Extensible Design

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the ASU Discord Bot on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashworks1706/SparkyAI.git
cd sparkyai
```

---

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

#### On Linux/Mac:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python.12.3 packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Configure API Keys and Credentials

The bot requires several API keys and configuration files to function properly.

1. **Create a `appConfig.json` file** in the `config/` folder with the following structure [Example](/__sample__appConfig.json):
2. **Add Firebase API credentials** [Example](/__sample_firebase_secret.json):

   - Download the `firebase_secret.json` file from your Firebase Cloud Console.
   - Place it in the `config/` folder.

---

### 5. Set Up Qdrant Vector Database

The bot uses Qdrant for vector-based similarity search. Run Qdrant using Docker.

#### Install Docker (if not installed):

Follow [Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

#### Start Qdrant:

Run the following command to start Qdrant on port `6333`:

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage qdrant/qdrant
```

> **Note:** On Windows, replace `$(pwd)` with `%cd%` or `${PWD}` if using PowerShell.

---

### 6. Install Chrome Dependencies (for Web Scraping)

The bot uses Selenium for web scraping. Ensure Chrome and Chromedriver are installed.

#### On Linux:

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb 
sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb 

sudo wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=133.0.6943.141
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver

sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver xvfb libxss1 libnss3 libatk1.0-0 libgtk-3-0
```

#### On Windows:

1. Download and install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
2. Download the appropriate Chromedriver version from [Chromedriver Downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
3. Add Chromedriver to your system PATH.

---

### 7. Run the Bot

Start the bot by running the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see logs indicating that the bot has started successfully.

---

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Qdrant Not Running:**

   - Ensure Docker is installed and running.
   - Verify that port `6333` is available on your system.
   - Check Qdrant logs for errors by running:
     ```bash
     docker logs 
     ```
2. **Missing API Keys:**

   - Double-check that your `config.json` file is correctly formatted and placed in the `config/` folder.
   - Ensure all required keys are present.
3. **Chromedriver Errors:**

   - Make sure you have installed a compatible version of Chromedriver for your version of Chrome.
   - Verify that Chromedriver is in your system PATH.
4. **Dependency Issues:**

   - If you encounter dependency errors, try upgrading pip and reinstalling requirements:
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade pip
     pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
     ```
