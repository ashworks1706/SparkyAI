**Common Types of Holds and How to Resolve Them:**

*   **Academic Advising Hold:** Requires you to meet with your academic advisor before registering. Contact your advising office to schedule an appointment.

How do I enroll in direct deposit through My ASU?,"While many student services are accessible through MyASU, setting up direct deposit for refunds or payroll (if you're a student worker) is usually handled through a separate system, often managed by Student Business Services or Payroll. MyASU might provide a link, but the setup process is typically external.

**How to Enroll in Direct Deposit:**

1.  **Search the ASU Website for ""Direct Deposit,"" ""Student Refunds,"" or ""Payroll"":** The best way to find the correct information is to search on the main ASU website (asu.edu) using keywords like ""direct deposit,"" ""student refunds,"" ""payroll,"" or ""electronic refunds.""
2.  **Check the Student Business Services or Payroll Website:** These offices are usually responsible for managing direct deposit. Look for information on their websites.
3.  **(Potential Links in MyASU):** MyASU *might* have links to the relevant pages for setting up direct deposit. Look for sections related to ""Finances,"" ""My Finances,"" ""Student Accounts,"" or ""Payroll.""

**Information You Will Typically Need:**

*   **Bank Name:** The name of your bank or credit union.
*   **Bank Account Number:** Your checking or savings account number.
*   **Bank Routing Number (ABA Routing Number):** The routing number for your bank. This is a nine-digit number that identifies your bank.
*   **Account Type:** Whether you want to deposit funds into a checking or savings account.

**Why Direct Deposit Setup Is Often External to MyASU:**

*   **Financial Security:** Handling banking information requires strict security protocols. Keeping this process separate from the general student portal can enhance security.
*   **Integration with Banking Systems:** Direct deposit requires integration with banking systems, which are often handled by specialized financial software.
*   **Payroll vs. Refunds:** The process might be slightly different depending on whether you're setting up direct deposit for student refunds or for payroll if you work for ASU.

**Key Points:**

*   **asu.edu (Search is Best):** Searching the ASU website is the most efficient way to find the direct deposit setup information.
*   **Student Business Services/Payroll:** These offices are usually responsible for direct deposit.
*   **MyASU May Provide Links:** Look for links within MyASU that might redirect you to the correct resources.

By following these steps, you can find the correct way to enroll in direct deposit at ASU."
Can I grant parent/guest access to My ASU?,"ASU, like most universities, is bound by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which protects the privacy of student educational records. Because of FERPA, parents or guests cannot directly access a student's MyASU account without the student's explicit consent. ASU provides a method for students to grant this access, often called ""Authorized User Access,"" ""Guest Access,"" or similar.

**How to Grant Parent/Guest Access:**

1.  **Log in to MyASU:** Go to my.asu.edu and log in with your ASUrite ID and password.
2.  **Look for ""Profile,"" ""Personal Information,"" ""Account,"" or ""Authorized Users"":** Look for a section related to your profile, account settings, or authorized users. The label may vary slightly.
3.  **Find the ""Authorized User Access,"" ""Guest Access,"" or Similar Option:** Within your profile or account settings, there should be an option to grant access to a parent or guest.
4.  **Add Guest Information:** You will typically need to provide the guest's name and email address.
5.  **Set Permissions/Access Levels:** This is a crucial step. You will choose what information your guest can access. Common options include:
    *   **Financial Information:** Access to tuition bills, payment history, and financial aid information.
    *   **Academic Information:** Access to grades, from  *
classschedule, and academic progress reports.
    *   **Both Financial and Academic Information:**
6.  **Save/Confirm Changes:** Once you have set the permissions, save or confirm the changes. Your guest will usually receive an email with instructions on how to access the designated information.

**Limitations and Settings:**

*   **Student Control:** The student has complete control over what information the guest can access.
*   **Revoking Access:** The student can revoke guest access at any time.
*   **FERPA Protection:** This process is designed to comply with FERPA regulations.
*   **No Direct Login to Student's MyASU:** The guest will not log in *as* the student. They will have a separate login with limited access to the designated information.

**Key Points:**

*   **FERPA is Important:** FERPA protects student privacy, and ASU takes this very seriously.
*   **Student Initiated:** The student *must* initiate the process of granting guest access.
*   **Control Over Access:** Students have full control over what information their guests can see.
*   **Check the ASU Website for Specific Instructions:** The exact steps and labels within MyASU might change slightly. Search ""ASU guest access"" or ""ASU parent access"" on the ASU website for the most current instructions.

By following these steps, students can grant limited access to their MyASU information to parents or guests while maintaining control over their privacy."

*   **External Standardized Tests (Unless Sent to ASU):** Scores from tests not directly related to ASU admission or placement (e.g., GRE, GMAT, MCAT) will not be available unless you specifically had them sent to ASU.

**Key Points:**

Where can I find information about my residency status on My ASU?,"Your residency status at ASU is important because it affects your tuition rates.

**Where to Find Your Current Residency Status (Potentially on MyASU):**

1.  **Log in to MyASU:** Go to my.asu.edu and log in with your ASUrite ID and password.
2.  **Look for ""Profile,"" ""Personal Information,"" ""Student Profile,"" or Similar:** There might be a section related to your personal information or student profile.

**How to Update Your Residency Status:**

Updating your residency status is *not* typically done directly through MyASU. It requires submitting documentation to the Residency Office.

1.  **Visit the Residency Office Website:** The ASU Residency Office website is the primary source for information about residency requirements and the application process. Search ""ASU residency"" on asu.edu to find this office.
2.  **Review Residency Requirements:** Carefully review the residency requirements for tuition purposes. These requirements are set by the Arizona Board of Regents and can be complex.
3.  **Gather Required Documentation:** Gather all the necessary documentation to support your claim for residency. This might include things like:
    *   Arizona driver's license or state ID
    *   Arizona vehicle registration
    *   Proof of physical presence in Arizona for the required time period
    *   Tax returns
    *   Utility bills

*   **Documentation and Verification:** The process requires careful review of documentation to verify residency claims.
*   **Specialized Expertise:** The Residency Office has specialized expertise in interpreting and applying residency rules.

**Key Points:**

*   **Check the Residency Office Website:** This is the most important resource for information about residency requirements and how to apply for a change in status.
*   **MyASU May Display Your Current Status:** MyASU might show your current classification, but it's not where you make changes.
*   **Contact the Residency Office:** If you have any questions about residency requirements or the application process, contact the Residency Office directly.

By following these steps and working with the Residency Office, you can address any residency-related issues and ensure you are classified correctly for tuition purposes."

How do I check the status of my open cases on My ASU?,"The ability to directly track the status of ""open cases"" within My ASU depends on the specific type of request you submitted and the department handling it. There isn't a universal ""case tracking"" feature across all services within My ASU.

Here's how you can generally check on the status of different types of requests:

While My ASU doesn't offer a direct group chat feature, Canvas and other communication platforms used by instructors, along with student organizations and independently organized study groups, are the primary ways students connect and communicate with each other."
How do I purchase from  *
classmaterials through My ASU?,"While My ASU doesn't directly sell or process payments for all from  *

Where can I make library room reservations on My ASU?,"Library room reservations are generally handled through the ASU Library website, not directly within My ASU. My ASU may provide links to the library website, but the reservation system resides on the library's site.

Here's how to make library room reservations:

1. **Go to the ASU Library Website:** Start at the ASU Library website ([lib.asu.edu](lib.asu.edu)).

2. **Look for ""Study Rooms,"" ""Group Study Rooms,"" or ""Reserve a Room"":** The library website will have a section dedicated to study spaces. Look for terms like ""Study Rooms,"" ""Group Study Rooms,"" ""Reserve a Room,"" or similar.

3. **Use the Reservation System:** The library website will have an online reservation system. This system will typically allow you to:
    * **Select a Library:** Choose the specific ASU library where you want to reserve a room (e.g., Hayden Library, Noble Library).
    * **Choose a Date and Time:** Select the date and time you need the room.
    * **Select a Room Type/Size:** Choose the type of room you need (e.g., individual study room, group study room) and the appropriate size.
    * **Confirm Your Reservation:** Once you've selected your preferences, you'll need to confirm your reservation. You may need to log in with your ASUrite ID and password.

4. **Confirmation Email:** You should receive a confirmation email with details of your reservation.

5. **My ASU and Library Resources:** My ASU may have links to the ASU Library website within sections related to academic resources or student services. These links will take you to the library website, where you can then make reservations.

In summary, library room reservations are made through the ASU Library website, not directly within My ASU. My ASU might offer links to the library website, but the reservation process is handled on the library's platform."
How do I customize my news and events feed on My ASU?,"My ASU's primary function is to provide personalized academic information and access to relevant resources, not to serve as a highly customizable news and events aggregator. Therefore, the level of customization for the news and events feed on My ASU is generally limited.

Here's what you can typically expect:

1. **Targeted Announcements:** The announcements and news displayed on My ASU are usually targeted to specific student populations based on factors like:
    * **Major:** You may see announcements related to your academic program or college.
    * **Student Status:** Announcements might be relevant to undergraduate, graduate, or online students.
    * **Enrollment Status:** You might see announcements related to registration, financial aid deadlines, or other time-sensitive information.

2. **Limited Customization:** There is usually *not* a feature to select specific news categories or topics to follow. The announcements are generally determined by ASU based on what they deem relevant to different student groups.

3. **Focus on Actionable Information:** The news and announcements on My ASU primarily focus on actionable information related to your academic progress, deadlines, and important resources. They are not intended to be a comprehensive news source for all ASU happenings.

4. **External Resources for Broader News:** For broader ASU news and events, you should rely on:
    * **ASU News Website:** The official ASU News website ([news.asu.edu](news.asu.edu)) provides comprehensive coverage of university news.
    * **College/School Websites:** Individual colleges and schools have their own news and events sections on their websites.
    * **ASU Social Media:** ASU and its various departments maintain active social media accounts.

In summary, My ASU's news and events feed is not highly customizable. It provides targeted announcements based on your student profile. For broader ASU news and events, you should refer to external resources like the ASU News website and college/school websites."
Can I access the ASU mobile app through My ASU?,"No, you cannot access the ASU mobile app *through* My ASU. My ASU is a web portal accessed through a web browser, while the ASU mobile app is a standalone application installed on your mobile device. They are separate platforms.

However, My ASU and the ASU mobile app often provide similar information and functionalities, though presented in different formats.

Here's how to access the ASU mobile app:

1. **Download the App:** Go to your device's app store (Apple App Store for iOS devices or Google Play Store for Android devices).

2. **Search for ""ASU Mobile"":** Search for the official ASU mobile app.

3. **Install the App:** Download and install the app on your device.

4. **Open the App:** Once installed, open the ASU mobile app.

5. **Log in:** You will likely need to log in with your ASUrite ID and password to access personalized information.

Key differences between My ASU and the ASU mobile app:

*   **Access Method:** My ASU is accessed through a web browser (on a computer or mobile device), while the ASU mobile app is a dedicated application.
*   **User Interface:** The user interface is different, optimized for web browsing versus mobile use.
*   **Functionality:** While both offer access to many of the same features (grades, from  *
classschedules, etc.), some features might be more easily accessible or presented differently in each platform.

In summary, you don't access the ASU mobile app *through* My ASU. You download and install the app separately from your device's app store. Both platforms provide access to important ASU information and resources, but they are distinct applications."
How do I view and update my iPOS (graduate students) on My ASU?,"Graduate students manage their iPOS (Interactive Plan of Study) through a specific section within My ASU. Here's how:

1. **Log in to My ASU:** Go to [my.asu.edu](my.asu.edu) and log in with your ASUrite ID and password.

2. **Navigate to ""My Programs"" or ""Graduate Resources"":** Look for a tile or link labeled ""My Programs,"" ""Graduate Resources,"" ""Graduate Student Services,"" or similar. This is often found on the main My ASU dashboard or within a menu. The exact wording may vary slightly.

3. **Find the iPOS Section:** Within this section, there should be a link or tab specifically for ""iPOS,"" ""Interactive Plan of Study,"" ""Graduate Plan of Study,"" or similar.

4. **View Your iPOS:** Clicking on the iPOS link will take you to your personalized iPOS. Here you can typically:
    * **View your planned coursework:** See the courses you have listed on your plan of study.
    * **View your committee information:** See the members of your graduate committee.
    * **View milestones and deadlines:** Track progress toward degree completion.

5. **Update Your iPOS:** The iPOS system usually allows you to make changes, such as:
    * **Adding or removing courses:** With advisor approval, you can adjust your planned coursework.
    * **Updating committee information:** You can update your committee members as needed.
    * **Submitting changes for approval:** Any changes you make to your iPOS will typically need to be approved by your advisor and/or graduate program.

6. **Consult with Your Advisor:** It is crucial to work closely with your academic advisor throughout the iPOS process. They can provide guidance on course selection, committee formation, and other important aspects of your graduate program.

In summary, graduate students access and manage their iPOS through a dedicated section within My ASU, usually found under ""My Programs"" or ""Graduate Resources."" The iPOS system allows you to view, update, and submit changes to your plan of study, but always consult with your advisor for guidance."
Where can I find information about upcoming workshops on My ASU?,"Information about upcoming workshops is generally not centrally located within My ASU itself. Workshops are typically organized and promoted by individual departments, colleges, or student services. Therefore, you need to look in several places:

1. **ASU Events Calendar:** The main ASU website ([www.asu.edu](www.asu.edu)) has an events calendar that lists university-wide events, including some workshops. Search for ""events"" or ""calendar"" on the ASU homepage.

2. **College/School Websites:** Individual colleges and schools often list workshops relevant to their students on their websites. Go to your college's website (e.g., Fulton Schools of Engineering website) and look for ""Events,"" ""News,"" or ""Announcements.""

3. **Student Services Websites:** Various student services offices (e.g., Career and Professional Development Services, Student Success Centers, University Technology Office (UTO)) offer workshops and often promote them on their websites. Search for the specific service you are interested in on the ASU website.

4. **Canvas (Course Websites):** If a workshop is directly related to a course, your instructor may post information about it on the course's Canvas page.

5. **My ASU Announcements (Limited):** Occasionally, My ASU might feature announcements about significant workshops, but this is not the primary source for this information.

6. **Student Organizations and Clubs:** Student organizations and clubs often host workshops or invite guest speakers. Check with organizations related to your interests.

Here's a breakdown of where to look based on the type of workshop:

*   **Career-related workshops:** Check the Career and Professional Development Services website and Handshake.
*   **Academic skills workshops:** Check your college/school website or the Student Success Centers website.
*   **Technology workshops:** Check the UTO website.

In summary, there is no single location in My ASU to find all upcoming workshops. You need to check various websites and resources depending on the type of workshop you are looking for. The ASU Events Calendar, college/school websites, and student services websites are good starting points."
How do I access BannerWeb through My ASU?,"BannerWeb is not directly accessed *through* My ASU. My ASU is a more modern, student-centric portal that provides access to many of the same functionalities as BannerWeb, but in a more user-friendly interface. BannerWeb is an older system that is being phased out in favor of the more integrated My ASU experience.

Therefore, you generally do not need to access BannerWeb directly. Most of the tasks you would have previously performed in BannerWeb, such as:

*   **Registering for classes:** Done through the ""Classes"" or ""Registration"" section in My ASU.
*   **Viewing grades:** Accessible through the ""Grades"" or ""Academic Progress"" section in My ASU.
*   **Viewing your student account/billing information:** Available in the ""Finances"" or ""Student Business Services"" section of My ASU.
*   **Updating personal information:** Usually handled within your My ASU profile settings.

If, for some specific reason, you require access to a function that is *only* available in BannerWeb (which is increasingly rare), you would typically access it through a direct link, which might be found on specific ASU departmental websites (like the Registrar's Office) or by searching ""BannerWeb"" on the ASU website. However, for the vast majority of student needs, My ASU provides the necessary tools and information.

In short, you don't access BannerWeb *through* My ASU. My ASU has largely replaced BannerWeb for most student tasks. Use My ASU for your student needs. If you encounter a specific situation where you believe you need BannerWeb, search for it on the ASU website or consult with the relevant department."
Can I view my employment information on My ASU?,"hether you can view employment information on My ASU depends on the *type* of employment.

*   **Student Employment (On-Campus Jobs):** If you are a student employed by ASU (e.g., as a student worker, teaching assistant, research assistant), some employment-related information *may* be accessible through My ASU, though often it directs you to other systems. This information might include:
    *   **Paystubs/Payroll Information:** This is usually accessed through a separate payroll system, often Workday, which you can access through a link from My ASU or directly. Look for links related to ""Payroll,"" ""HR,"" or ""Employee Resources.""
    *   **Tax Forms (W-2s):** These are also typically accessed through the payroll system (Workday).
    *   **Job Information (Sometimes):** Some departments may list student employment opportunities or related information within their departmental pages on the ASU website, which you may be able to access via links from My ASU.

*   **Staff/Faculty Employment:** If you are staff or faculty at ASU, your employment information (paystubs, benefits, etc.) is managed through the HR system, primarily Workday. This is *not* directly accessible within the main student-focused My ASU portal. You would access Workday through a separate link, usually found on the ASU HR website or by searching for ""Workday ASU"" on the ASU website.

In summary:

*   **Student Employees:** Some limited employment-related information may be accessible via links from My ASU, usually directing you to Workday or other systems.
*   **Staff/Faculty:** Employment information is managed through Workday and is not accessible through the student-focused My ASU portal.

To find your employment information, search for ""Workday"" on the ASU website or look for links related to ""Payroll,"" ""HR,"" or ""Employee Resources"" within My ASU (if you are a student employee)."
How do I check my Financial Aid SAP status on My ASU?,"You can usually find your Financial Aid SAP (Satisfactory Academic Progress) status within the Financial Aid section of My ASU. Here's how:

1. **Log in to My ASU:** Go to [my.asu.edu](my.asu.edu) and log in with your ASUrite ID and password.

2. **Navigate to the Financial Aid Section:** Look for a tile or link labeled ""Financial Aid,"" ""Financial Aid and Scholarships,"" or similar. This is often located on the main My ASU dashboard or within a menu.

3. **Look for ""SAP Status,"" ""Satisfactory Academic Progress,"" or similar:** Within the Financial Aid section, there should be information related to your SAP status. This might be under a heading like ""Eligibility,"" ""Requirements,"" ""My Awards,"" or similar. Look for phrases like:
    *   ""SAP Status""
    *   ""Satisfactory Academic Progress""
    *   ""Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress""
    *   ""SAP Evaluation""

4. **Review Your SAP Information:** The SAP information will typically indicate whether you are meeting the requirements for financial aid eligibility. It may include details about:
    *   **Cumulative GPA:** Your overall GPA.
    *   **Pace of Completion:** The percentage of attempted credits you have successfully completed.
    *   **Maximum Timeframe:** The maximum time allowed to complete your degree while receiving financial aid.

5. **Contact the Financial Aid Office:** If you cannot find your SAP status within My ASU or if you have questions about your SAP status, the best course of action is to contact the ASU Financial Aid and Scholarship Services office directly. They can provide personalized assistance and explain any specific requirements or policies related to your situation.

In summary, you can usually find your Financial Aid SAP status within the Financial Aid section of My ASU. Look for headings or phrases related to ""SAP,"" ""Satisfactory Academic Progress,"" or ""Eligibility."" If you have any questions, contact the Financial Aid office directly."
Where can I find Registrar's Office forms on My ASU?,"While some actions related to Registrar's Office tasks can be completed directly within My ASU (like registering for classes or viewing grades), actual forms are typically found on the Registrar's Office website, not directly within My ASU. My ASU may provide links to the Registrar's website.

Here's how to find Registrar's Office forms:

1. **Go to the ASU Registrar's Office Website:** The most direct way to find forms is to visit the ASU Registrar's Office website. You can find it by searching ""ASU Registrar"" on the main ASU website ([www.asu.edu](www.asu.edu)).

2. **Look for a ""Forms,"" ""Resources,"" or ""Student Forms"" Section:** The Registrar's Office website will usually have a section dedicated to forms. Look for headings like:
    *   ""Forms""
    *   ""Student Forms""
    *   ""Resources""
    *   ""Petitions""

3. **Browse or Search for the Specific Form:** The forms are often organized by category (e.g., registration, transcripts, graduation). You can browse the categories or use the website's search function to find the specific form you need.

4. **My ASU and Registrar's Resources:** My ASU may have links to the Registrar's Office website within sections related to academics, registration, or student services. These links will take you directly to the Registrar's website where you can find the forms.

Examples of common Registrar's Office forms:

*   **Change of Major/Minor:** Used to officially change your academic program.
*   **Transcript Request:** Used to order official transcripts.
*   **Graduation Application:** Used to apply for graduation.
*   **Enrollment Verification:** Used to verify your enrollment status.

In summary, Registrar's Office forms are found on the ASU Registrar's Office website, not within My ASU itself. My ASU may provide links to the Registrar's website, but the forms are hosted there."
How do I access GaView through My ASU?,"GaView is not accessed through My ASU. GaView was an older system used for course evaluations and has been replaced by a new system called Course Evaluations. Therefore, there is no direct way to access GaView through My ASU because the platform itself is no longer in use.

To access course evaluations, you should:

1. **Check Your ASU Email:** You will typically receive an email notification when course evaluations are open for your courses. This email will contain a direct link to the evaluation platform.

2. **Access Through Canvas (Potentially):** Some instructors may post a link to course evaluations within their Canvas course page.

3. **Look for ""Course Evaluations"" on the ASU Website:** You can try searching for ""Course Evaluations"" on the main ASU website ([www.asu.edu](www.asu.edu)). This may lead you to the current course evaluation platform.

In summary, GaView is no longer used. Course evaluations are now conducted through a new system, accessed primarily via email notification or potentially through Canvas. There is no link to GaView or the new course evaluation system within My ASU itself."
Can I customize the background of My ASU portal?,"The ability to customize the background of the My ASU portal is very limited, if available at all. ASU periodically updates the My ASU interface, and customization options can change or be removed.

Generally, you *cannot* upload your own images or choose custom colors for the background of My ASU. Any visual changes are usually limited to:

1. **Themes (If Available):** In some versions of My ASU, there might be a limited selection of pre-designed themes or color schemes that you can choose from. This option, if present, is usually found within your account settings or profile preferences. Look for a gear icon, your name/initials, or a similar menu.

2. **Seasonal or Event-Based Changes:** ASU might occasionally change the My ASU background or theme to reflect special events, holidays, or university-wide initiatives. These changes are applied to all users and cannot be customized individually.

3. **Accessibility Options (High Contrast):** My ASU does provide accessibility options, such as high-contrast modes, which change the color scheme to improve readability for users with visual impairments. These options are usually found in the settings or accessibility menu.

If you can't find any options related to background customization within your My ASU settings, it's highly likely that this feature is not currently available. ASU focuses on providing a consistent and functional experience for all users, so extensive customization is usually not a priority.

In summary, extensive customization of the My ASU background is generally not possible. There may be limited pre-designed themes or color schemes, but you typically cannot upload your own images or choose custom colors."
